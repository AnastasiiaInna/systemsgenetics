#Cell type specific allele specific expresion detection. 

##Introduction
This module can be used for the detection of allele specific expression, with the novel option of including cell type specific effects when dealing with heterogenous tissues.

The module is separated into three sub-modules:

1. ASreads
2. ASEperSNP
3. ASEperRegion
